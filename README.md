# Maze-Generator-XOJO

The algorithm used is called the Recursive Backtracker. I used a software called XOJO. It uses the language REALbasic derived from the BASIC object-oriented programming language. This is the language and IDE I used in my High School programming classes. 

BTW some names are in French, most in English. I went to a French High School. 

If you want to run it:
    -Download the .xojo_binary_project file along with the other folders     
    -Put it all in one folder call it whatever you want      
    -Download XOJO: https://www.xojo.com/download/     ( You need to make an account unfortunately )     
    -Open the file you downloaded    
    -Click on the big run button at the top of your screen   
    -Follow the instructions to play
