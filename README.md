# Maze-Generator-XOJO

The algorithm used is called the Recursive Backtracker. I take the maze and render it in 3D and created a maze game out of it with different 3D models for different players. I used a software called XOJO. It uses the language REALbasic derived from the BASIC object-oriented programming language. This is the language and IDE I used in my High School programming classes. 

BTW some names are in French, most in English. I went to a French High School.
